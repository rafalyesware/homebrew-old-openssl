# Rafal's Homebrew Relics

**NOTE**: these formulae are older than dirt.  You don't want them.  I'm only pushing them here in case I need to revive some ancient piece of software that relies on these.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install rafalyesware/homebrew-relics/<formula>`

Or `brew tap rafalyesware/relics` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
